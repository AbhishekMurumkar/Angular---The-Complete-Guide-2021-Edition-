# Observables

## what it is?

* In general, its just like a data source like events (user inputs), Http requests, events triggered in code etc.
* But In angular, it is a package we import from ```rxjs/Observables```(third party) which follows Observable pattern
* Which means we have following parts 
    1.Observable : event or data thrown by this agent via events, http request or via code.
    2.Oberserver/Subscriber : event or data thrown by above agent will be received by this agent.Then later based on this data received we modify code to act upon that data. This is where we write our code in angular to act upon received data.
    * **_The data which recevied here is handled asynchronously_**.
    * **_These are like callbacks and promises but use a different approach to handle data_**
    * Angular uses observables a lot and its major advantage is
    * There are 3 ways of handling this data/hooks:
        1. Handle data:
        2. Handle error:
        3. Handle Completion:
