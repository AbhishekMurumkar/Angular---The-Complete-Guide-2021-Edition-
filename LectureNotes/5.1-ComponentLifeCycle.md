# [LifeCycle & methods of the component](#lifeCycle)

## Change detection Cycle

* Before diving into the lifecycle hooks, we need to understand the change detection cycle.
* Change detection is the mechanism by which angular keeps the template in sync with the component
* During the change detection cycle angular checks each and every bound property in the template, with that of the component class. If it detects any changes it updates the DOM. 
* Angular raises the life cycle hooks during the important stages of the change detection  mechanism.

## Life Cycle Hooks of a components in Angular

> Angular is responsible and will run these methods whenever they are present in our code

> Although there is no need to specify the interfaces(below)that our component uses, but its a good practise as it describes the life cycle methods which uses and which it doesnt

| SNo |Name | description|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | constructor | only when the component was loaded into angular for first time <br> Angular makes use of a constructor to inject dependencies |
| 1 |ngOnChanges | >> **First one to be called** <br> >> this is called for **_every change in the HTML BOUND input elements_** <br> >> The point means any variable that is referred with ```@Input``` Decorator receives new values <br> >> This is executed multiple times |
| 2 | ngOnInit | >> **called when component has been initialized** <br> >> or when the component object is created but not yet displayed to user <br> >> **_This is being run after executing constructor_** <br> >> **This is called every time a new instance of a component is created**|
| 3 | ngDoCheck | >> **Called for every change in component is detected**(whether inside of a component or on a template) <br> >> This is executed multiple times <br> >> This is mostly used after a promise returns the data or when an event is fired |
| 4 | ngContentInit | >> called after ng-content <br> >> called after content of the parent component which call child component to load |
| 5 | ngAfterContentChecked | called every time projected content has been checked <br> >> Runs after every change detection completion in component along with childs |
| 6 | ngAfterView | >> Called after the Component's (and Child views) has been initialized |
| 7 | ngAfterViewChecked | >> Called every time the View(and Childs view) has been checked <br> >> this is called after all the changes been executed in view|
| 8 | ngOnDestroy | >> This is used when component is removed from DOM (especially when we are using ng-If) <br> >> this mostly used to perform clean up actions |
